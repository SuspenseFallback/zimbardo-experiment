# Aim

## What was the aim of the experiment?

Zimbardo set up the experiment to see brutality of prison guards was the result of sadistic personalities or whether it was created by the situation.

The experiment also took a dive into the psychological topic of deindividuation, where a person loses their personality/identity when part of a group, which is a part of _group mentality._

The situation also looked at social roles - how people's perspective of social roles affects how they would act in a position of a social role. It also looks at what people would do when given both power and responsibility.
