# Conclusion

## What conclusions did Zimbardo make?

- The situation can allow people to _conform_ to social roles easily
- The social roles were very easily taken on - even by volunteers who wanted to 'pretend' ended up behaving as if they were in a prison
- The prisoners were easily deindividuated and slowly became depressed and anxious
- The guards quickly stopped following rules and starting abusing their power

## What conclusions can we make?

- We should not try and abuse our power in new or old social roles that we have
- Pro-social behaviour can be very difficult in a position of power
- Anti-social behaviour can always be viewed in different perspectives that are influenced by situational and personal factors
- We should not try and go out of our way to hurt people

## What conclusions did the world make?

- These kinds of harsh psychological experiments with low pay where participants don't know the potential mental health effects are extremely unethical
- Ethics in all experiments should be regulated
- We need boards/committees to help regulate experiments
- We need people's _informed_ consent for psychological experiments
