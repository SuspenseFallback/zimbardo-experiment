# Evaluation

## Strengths

### Reliability - Control

Zimbardo and his colleagues had some control over vriables. The most obvious example was the selection of participants. He ensured that the participants were mentally stable before taking part.

However, the participants were given a choice as to whether they wanted to be a guard or a prisoner. All 20 participants chose guard. Because of this, Zimbardo and his team used a coin toss, which is random selection, to choose guards and prisoners. The

This eliminates the chance of bias, making the experiment more reliable, as it makes sure that the experiment tests random people in different social roles instead of having people who are predisposed to certain social roles.

### Change in prisons

A strength of the study is that it has altered the way US prisons are run. After seeing the horrors of he experiment, there have been lots of changes to prisons and the legal system to ensure that prisoner's psychological/mental health is in good condition.

For example, juveniles who are accused of federal crime are now housed in separate prisons instead of adult prisoners, before their trial. Before, this opened up possibilities of abuse and harassment of the juvenile prisoner, but now ensures their safety. Furthermore, they can now also call their parents, etc.

### Change in ethics

Another strength of the study is that it has brought change to ethics in modern psychology. After the experiment was conducted in 1971, it led to the formal recognition of ethical guidelines by the American Psychological Association. Other countries also led, suit, such as the ethics committee in the UK. Now, all psychological experiments must go through an extensive evaluation process by the ethical boards/committees of each country to ensure the safety of the participants, observers, and others.

## Weaknesses

### Generalisability

The study is not generalisable. This is because the participants are 20 American males. This sample size is very small. It also cannot be used to generalise the whole population because American society and culture is very different to other societies, where there might be less/more/different influence on random people from popular media about social roles, prisoners, guards, etc.

For example, some movies in other parts of the world involve police and guards beating up suspects and prisoners as a dramatic device and something to build suspense. This, however, is very illegal and wrong. The problem is that this can influence the behaviour of people who have been frequently exposed to these kinds of media and can influence the way they conform to their new social roles.

### Lack of realism and opposing studies

Banuarziz and Mohavedi (1975) argued the participants were merely play-acting rather than actually being in a real situation int their role. They argued that stereotypes do not reflect the real behaviour of people who have training and experience. See <a href="#debates">Debates</a> for more.

## What would happen now?

In the current social climate, I (Krithin Jay Pakshootra), believe that this same experiment would not happen, and even if it did, the results would be vastly different.

First of all, following the experiment, there have been lots of changes to the ethical guidelines of psychology, as I have mentioned before on this site multiple times. This would mean that such an experiment would not happen, and if it did, it would be _extremely_ closely monitored by multiple individuals to ensure that the prisoners and guards are safe.

Additionally, if it did happen, the situational factors would change. People have lots more knowledge about psychology and ethics, which would make them much less likely to do something like this. The pay of $15/hour would be too less now - there has been a 659% cumulative increase in the value of USD now, making that $15/hour now $114/hour - much more. The students at Stanford would also be much smarter, since it is such a prestigious university, making them even less likely to join the experiment.

## Debates

### Validity

Lots of people argue that the experiment was not valid, meaning it did not test what it meant to and was not true to life. People say that it was staged, others say that the results were very exaggerated, and that there is no way that people could be that psychologically devasted by prison.

On the flip side, some people might not be taking into account the fact that the experiment was not held in a real prison, and it was held in a mock prison with _random people_ as guards to see how people would fit into social roles.

Furthermore, the experiment later concluded that there were no lasting psychological effects on the participants, who later went on to say that even though they knew it was fake, it felt very real. Some argue that this was staged too, but no one actually knows.
