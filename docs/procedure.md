# Procedure

## What was the procedure?

### Step 1: Find participants

Zimbardo and his team put ads in newspapers to find 20 college students from Stamford to join the experiment.

- They would be paid $15/hour (which was quite a lot at the time)
- They would have to stay there for 14 days - a fortnite
- They would be arrested in real life and processed, just as if they were in real prison

### Step 2: Choose between guards and prisoners

Zimbardo and his team asked each participant if they wanted to be a guard or a prisoner. They also conducted psychological tests on them.

All 20 chose guards.

Because of this, Zimbardo decided to use a coin-flip (random) to decide whether someone would be a guard or a prisoner.

However, the participants were told that their psychological test and decision affected the result. This made them believe that they were in control of their position and that they were built for it.

### Step 3: Arrest prisoners

Zimbardo and his team arrested the 'prisoners' in real life to make it seem more believable

- Each of them would be assigned a number instead of their names (for example, #4735)

### Step 4: Being in prison

The participants were then assigned their real roles once in the jail.

The prisoners had to:

- Wear prison clothes
- Get strip-searched
- Get processed
- Be randomly checked by guards
- Have roll call, lights out, etc.

The guards had to:

- Wear a uniform
- Wear sunglasses and a hat to conceal their identity
- Strip-search guards

### Rules

- No abuse/assault of the prisoners
- Everyone had to be interviewed regularly
- Prisoners could be put in solitary confinement, but only for an hour
