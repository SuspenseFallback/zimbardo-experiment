# Results

## Original plan

The original plan of the experiment was so that:

- The guards would follow the rules
- The experiment would last 14 days
- The prisoners psychological health would not be severely impacted.

However, these came about to be false during the real experiment.

## Actual results

### Day 1

There was a slow start. However, the guards began to take up their roles with enthusiasm. They were allowed to control almost every action of the prisoners, and did so. They also started abusing the prisoners, reminding them that they were being monitored and watched. Some harsh behaviour included headcounts at any time, including the middle of the night, interrupting the prisoner's sleep. This can have severe psychological effects on people, as we know today. The prisoners did not do anything much. However, one prisoner was released because Zimbardo had reason to suspect that he had some mild psychological disturbance.
 
### Day 2

The prisoners began to riot. They blocked the doorways with their mattresses, ripped their uniforms apart, messed up their cells and swore and yelled at the guards. In response to this, the guards used even more aggressive behaviour to put down the rebellion. They took away the prisoner's mattresses, placed harsher rules, sprayed fire extinguishers at them, and used divide-and-conquer tactics to try and make the prisoners against each other. This worked. The rebellion was put down.

### Day 3

After their rebellion was put down, the prisoners were subdued, depressed and anxious. One prisoner, prisoner #8612 had extreme psychological effects. He was extremely miserable, kept screaming, and was eventually taken to be interviewed by Zimbardo and his team. When interviewed, he had forgotten his own name. For that reason, prisoner #8612 was released.

### Day 4

Two more prisoners were released because of psychological effects. At this point, Zimbardo must have started to doubt the ethical validity of his experiment, but he pushed on. Prisoners that left were replaced by stand-by prisoners.

### Day 5

Prisoner #416, one of the new-comer prisoners, could not process the horrors that he was witnessing. Unlike the other prisoners who had witnessed a gradual increase in harassment and abuse, he was immediately exposed to the guards abusing and harassing them. As a method of coping, prisoner #416 went on a hunger strike. Even after trying to be force-fed by the guards, he refused to eat. So, the guards put him in "the hole", a method of solitary confinement, for 3 hours, instead of the 1 hour dictated by the rules. Prisoner #416 still refused.

Rather than being viewed as a hero among the prisoners, prisoner #416 was shunned as a troublemaker. The head guard exploited this by giving the prisoners a choice. Either lose their blankets and pillows or keep prisoner #416 in solitary confinement. Most people chose to keep their blankets and pillows. However, prisoner #416 was released later on in the night.

### Day 6

On day 6, the Stanford Prison Experiment was officially stopped. Even though it was supposed to happen for 2 weeks or 14 days, it only lasted 6 days due to the effects of the experiment on the prisoners and guards. Zimbardo later concluded that there was no lasting psychological damage to any participant, though this source is debated upon.
